# Criteria A : Planning

### Problem Definition (Client identification)
My client is a grade 11 student, Anju Yasu who is studying the IB diploma program at UWC ISAK Japan. One of her IB subjects is English B and the class is having a semester-long individual project called “Happiness Project”. In this project, every student has to complete a few tasks, and one of the tasks is called a Happiness journal –student has to write down what makes them happy in the form of a journal or diary. As an English B student, Anju wanted to record her journal on her laptop, so she wanted an application that she can type in her experience of that day, the date, diary/journal name, and who wrote it. In addition, since the diary may contain the personal information of the author, the client wants this application to have a register and login function to prevent other people to access her diary. 

### Success Criteria

1. The application has a register function to register a user’s email, username, and password and stored them in the database.

2. The application has a login function for users to log in to their diary with email and password which if the inputted information is correct the user will be able to access their diary and edit them.

3. Users can write the title, content and date added(in case the user wants to record the diary for other days and not that day) and click the save button to save the information in the database.

4. The application can automatically save the date and time last updated for each diary into the database.

5. The user can input their name to be saved as the author of the diary or if the user doesn’t input anything, the application will automatically use the username as the author.

### Rationale for the Proposed Solution
	In this project, I will use kivymd to create the application interface, SQLAlchemy to create and manage the database, and python 3.9 to create the function of the application. Firstly, I use kivymd to create the interface as kivymd is a simple framework that can allow the user to create the application interface like the login screen, home screen, and every interface needed in this project. Kivymd also provided their user with a detailed description, easy-to-follow example, and “how to use” for each command. In addition, Kivymd can also work with Python to create applications with good functionality. Secondly, SQLAlchemy is the main library that will be used in this project to create and organize the database that will collect the data inputted by users in the form of an online library. SQLAlchemy is being used in this project because it allows the client to easily see and understand all the information inputted in the table and allows them to sort the data as well. Moreover, SQLAlchemy allows me to use it along with normal python and kivymd and all of them can perfectly work together to create an application that can meet all the success criteria. Lastly, the main programming language that will be used in this project is Python because Python is a simple coding language that allows me to meet all the client’s requirements and it also allows me to create applications interface and manage the database by cooperating with Kivymd and SQLAlchemy mentioned before.
