# Why 0.1+0.2 == 0.3 is fault?

As you can see from the image above, the result of 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 is a fault and the answer of 0.1+ 0.2 in python is 0.30000000000000004 instead of 0.3.
This is due to how the computer deal with decimal numbers. As decimal numbers cannot be treated in the same way as integer, they needed to be converted into float numbers
which use binary floating point number to represent the decimal numbers. In the case with binary floating point number, 0.1 cannot be divide by 10 but needed to be divided by 1010(10 in binary)/
This gives an infinite decimal places for 0.1. After that, the binary number will be converted back to base 10 which its value can be greater or less than 0.1 based on the numbers of bit precision used.
In python, for example, 17 bits of precision has been applied to those numbers that have been converted back which makes 0.1 and 0.2 more than their value in base 10 while 0.3 in python is less than 0.3 in normal base-1.
Therefore, the result for 0.1 + 0.2 is more than 0.3. Hence, the result from 0.1+0.2 == 0.3 is false.


# Solution

There are 2 possible solutions for this. First is to set the precision to 1 by using round(0.1+0.2,1)==round(0.3,1) which will round the number to 1 decimal place. Hence, make the first part of equation 0.3 same as second part and give true in the result as shown in image below.

Another possible solution is by using module decimal and convert a string of decimal such as "0.1" to accurately convert to 1 decimal place decimal as shown below.
