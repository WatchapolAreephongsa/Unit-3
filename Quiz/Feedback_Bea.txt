There are some quizzes missing from the repositories from quiz 25 to quiz 30, quiz 31, and quiz 32. In your repositories, the quiz is well organized and easy 
to find, in each quiz, the variable names are well set which allows the user to understand the meaning of each variable and what is inside it. However, there 
is no comment for each part of the quiz which may confuse the user. Another thing that should be added, is the test result shows the output of each program.
